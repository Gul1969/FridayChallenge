A script to create a script

What was the challenge? - The challenge as to create a script that createsa new user group, a new user, adds this user to the new user group,creates a file called run.sh script with an echo command that is executabel by members od the group only, switches to the new user and then runs the run.sh script.

How I expected the challenge to go. - It was always going to be tough as I have no prior knowledge of Linux or Git. With just a few days of training it was always going ot be a daunting task, but we have access to some incredible resources in QA Community  and I always love a challenge.

What went well? - All the stuff we covered in the training came easily and early on I managed to come up with a strategy to break the problem down into small bits and test each of them while blocking off other bits using ""

What didn't go as planned? I didn't expect the challenge to be quite so sneaky in the way we had to create a script within a script and get it to execute it's own script. 

Possible improvements for future challenges. In future I would ask questions as early as possble to clear up any confusions or ambiguities, this would save a lot of time.
